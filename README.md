Control midi CC with webcam + face &amp; hand tracking

You can try at [https://tools.johnowhitaker.com/facewave](https://tools.johnowhitaker.com/facewave) (unless that site is down, it's a WIP)

Or hosted on GitHub pages from this repo at [https://johnowhitaker.github.io/facewave/](https://johnowhitaker.github.io/facewave/)

To use:
- Set up [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) or otherwise create a virtual midi loopback device
- Choose it as the midi output in the app (make sure you enable webcam access and midi access in Chrome)
- Add the loopback as an input device in your software of choice - I like using this with Roli's Equator 2 since that already has so many expressive sounds!

Please tag me @johnowhitaker on X etc if you use this, I'd love to see it in action with different performers!
